Metropolitan Ministries Hackathon for Social Good Challenge

Brief:
How might Metropolitan Ministries leverage digital solutions to quickly help those in crisis, provide useful information to the needy, create difference-making community engagement in Tampa Bay, and spark a sense of community ownership among young donors?

The Problems:
For Metropolitan Ministries, the rate of crisis intervention happening via social media channels, namely Facebook messenger, is drastically increasing. This new form of instant communication has opened an opportunity for better service but has also created immense strain on the Metropolitan Ministries marketing staff. Inquiries range from urgent crisis situations, to basic questions about food distribution, to donors requesting information on drop off and volunteering. There currently is no technology in place to rapidly address these concerns in a sensitive and appropriate way. The information that could help those in need is scattered across various channels and the Metropolitan Ministries website, neither of which are user friendly.


85% of Metropolitan Ministries support comes from private donations. Most of this support comes from The Greatest Generation and Baby Boomers. If Metropolitan Ministries is to persist in Tampa Bay they need to inspire a new generation of donors to engage with this community and feel a sense of ownership in the Metropolitan Ministries mission. They are currently struggling to develop strategies that provide an inspiring message to younger audiences that gets them to engage financially and socially.

Metropolitan Ministries is built on the idea that bringing the community together will solve many of the problems we face. There currently is not a great place for community members to help those in need, digitally. You can find small examples of this on the Metropolitan Ministries social media pages where people, unprompted, will offer information or direct help to those in need. The problem is no centralized place for the community to step in and directly help one another online on a person to person level.

Metropolitan Ministries Mission Goals:
Raise the level of engagement and effectiveness on digital platforms.

Resonate with a younger audience by creating a sense of ownership and connection the Metropolitan Ministries Mission. Instill the idea that the community drives the success of the organization and the region.

“When we’re doing things well, we’re bringing people together.”

SUMMARY:

My team decided to tackle the challenge by building a Chatbot that will be attached to the Ministries' Facebook Messenger App. Our team leader also felt it would be good to present a second aspect to our solution, which is to modify the Ministries' website's homepage to make it easier to obtain emergency help. As the Front End Developer on the team, I was assigned this second task.

This repo will contain the code for the solution I will build, which is as follows:

- A homepage with an animated "I need help" button that, when clicked, will open to a help page that is interactive
- Interactivity will include voice over work and an interactive google map (permission will be asked to get the user's location from their device)
- The user will be able to select to hear the voice interaction in English or in Spanish
- Easier to make donations
- More mobile friendly than the original site.
